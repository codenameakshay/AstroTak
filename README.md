To build on MacOS or Windows, please follow these simple steps.

**Step 1:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/codenameakshay/product-IO.git
```

**Step 2:**

Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio) to install Android Studio. Then you're ready to build the app.

For testing the app you can create an emulator following the steps [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator), or directly run on a physical Android device.

You should generate the necessary code first.
```shell
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

```shell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
